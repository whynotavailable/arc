# Plans

This project will handle token generation (not consumption).
It will have these endpoints.

* /token  
  For client authorization.
* /auth  
  For user authorization.
* /jwks.json  
  For token validation.

For now I just want client credentials and jwks. User auth is a
massive problem that I want to really take the time for (also I want
to make sure I's even something I want to do).
